"# LBPrePass" 
This prepass is intended to reduce debug time by catching spelling 
and case mistakes in function, variable and constant names. 
It does not change your source in any way but allows declarations 
to be made in a way transparent to the LB runtime. Useage is then checked 
against these declarations and a list of matching and non matching 
occurances produced.

LBPrePass checks LB 4.5.1 code and is written in LB 4.5.1 with 
declarations. 
The files named "Test..." are not intended to be runnable Liberty 
Basic. There are there as test files for LBPrePass.

Use at your own risk!!
